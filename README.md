Welcome to Judge the Bot! This project dives into how AI behaves in the real world and highlights where it can go wrong. Think of it as detective work for AI—finding bias, fairness issues, and suggesting fixes.

🔍 Overview

AI is everywhere, but it’s not perfect. This assignment explores two real-world scenarios where AI systems may unintentionally discriminate or misjudge people:

ResumeBot 5000 – A hiring AI that may reject candidates with career gaps, often disadvantaging women.

EagleEye – A remote exam proctoring AI that may flag neurodivergent students unfairly.

The goal is to analyze, detect problems, and propose responsible improvements.
